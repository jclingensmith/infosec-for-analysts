# infosec-for-analysts
Materials for workshops on information security for data analysts.

I'll use this repo to host presentations, notes, and resource lists as we continue to develop this material over time.

## Resources


### Threat models and mental frameworks

Ars Technica's explanation of [why threat models are useful for everyone](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-mostly-and-love-my-threat-model/ "How I learned to stop worrying (mostly) and love my threat model") is a good introduction to thinking about security.

The 2016 Uber hack is pretty much a perfect model of how to do everything wrong. I'll have a bunch more resources on each piece of this hack, but [How to Prevent the Uber Hack: 5 Defensive Tactics](https://www.hitachi-systems-security.com/blog/how-to-prevent-the-uber-hack/ "How to Prevent the Uber Hack: 5 Defensive Tactics") is a decent place to start.

### Cryptography

If I went through the basics of the Alice/Bob/Eve setup too fast, there's a [nine-minute video describing Alice and Bob's problem and how cryptography is supposed to solve it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNC3jCCGJ0o)

A quick [primer](https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/ "How does HTTPS actually work?") on what HTTPS does, and a good explanation of the way the encryption sequence between unfamiliar communication partners on the internet generally works.

A much more complete [resource list](https://github.com/sobolevn/awesome-cryptography "cryptography resources") on some of the basic concepts in cryptography

If you really like slides and you want way better ones than mine, check this [enormous slide deck from an Intro Cryptography course](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp18/cse127-b/cse127sp18.7.pdf) at UC-San Diego.

#### News articles and why encryption stuff is important

One of the founders of WhatsApp [walked away](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind/#2fc8726b3f20 "Forbes story on WhatsApp/Facebook controversy") from close to a billion dollars, in part because of a disagreement about who should hold the decryption keys: WhatsApp uses end-to-end (client-side) encryption. That means Facebook can't see WhatsApp messages, and therefore can't monetize them.

A news story from November 2018 illustrating how crypto is hard and you shouldn't trust somebody just because they charge tons of money and give themselves a tough-sounding name: ["Police decrypt 258,000 messages after breaking pricey IronChat crypto app"](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/police-decrypt-258000-messages-after-breaking-pricey-ironchat-crypto-app/?comments=1)

#### RSA encryption

RSA is one of the most important asymmetric cryptosystems. [How RSA Works (With Examples)](http://doctrina.org/How-RSA-Works-With-Examples.html)

A somewhat more terse [description of how RSA works](https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2014/03/30/rsa/ "RSA Encryption â€“ Keeping the Internet Secure")

A little walkthrough implementing RSA encryption in R: [Fun with bignum: how RSA encryption works](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openssl/vignettes/bignum.html)

#### End-to-end encryption

The stylized Alice/Bob/Eve setup doesn't take into account that Alice and Bob may be using some third-party service that connects them, like Gmail, Facebook, or WhatsApp. End-to-end encryption (aka client-side encryption) is an encryption system that doesn't let that third-party service see the contents of messages. The current best-practice system for E2EE is the Signal protocol: [Demystifying the Signal Protocol for End-to-End Encryption](https://blog.cloudboost.io/demystifying-the-signal-protocol-for-end-to-end-encryption-e2ee-3e31830c456f)

#### Man-in-the-middle attacks

MitM attacks are one of the main reasons you don't trust wifi in airports, hotels, etc. When Eve can impersonate Alice and/or Bob and collect (or change) the details of their conversation, she's committing a MitM attack. The security company Rapid7 has a slightly tech-y description of how MitM attacks actually happen in the real world and what we're supposed to do about them. [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Techniques and Prevention](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/man-in-the-middle-attacks/)

## End-User Security

### Passwords

Ars Technica's [How I Became a Password Cracker](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/how-i-became-a-password-cracker/) is a 2013 classic that walks through just how easy it is to learn to crack passwords. The follow-up, [Anatomy of a Hack](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/) demonstrates how seemingly good passwords are susceptible.
